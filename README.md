This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating through arrays. The `BuggyArray.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element outside of its bounds. The `FixedArray.java` file provides the corrected code.  Off-by-one errors are subtle but can lead to unexpected runtime exceptions. Always ensure your loop conditions accurately reflect the valid range of array indices.
